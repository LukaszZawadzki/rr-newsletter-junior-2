## React Rangers Newsletter Junior #1

*This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). See
[the official guide](GUIDE.md) to learn more about this tool.*

Welcome to another one in the series of React tasks that we send periodically to the subscribers
of [our official newsletter](http://eepurl.com/dyF8I9)! If you'd also like to challenge your React
programming skills and get professional code review, we'll be very happy to see you
[sign up](http://eepurl.com/dyF8I9)!

### Running

Make sure you run `npm install` first to install the dependencies.

[npm start](GUIDE.md#npm-start)

### The task

Implement a component containing `ThreeButtons` in [src/ThreeButtons.js](src/ThreeButtons.js). Every button should have its own individual numeric value in their label (aka the button's number). Clicking a button changes its number like so:
Button #1 → increases its number by 3
Button #2 → reduces its number by 7
Button #3 → changes its number to current sum of button #1 and button #2
The initial value of each button should be 0.

Submission deadline for code review: July 24th, 2018.
